\section{RANSAC and \textsc{SURF}}
\include{ransac_flowchart}
Speeded up robust features, \textsc{SURF}, is faster than \textsc{SIFT} according to its authors, thus it is better in a time-critical implementation.
It is also claimed to be more robust that \textsc{SIFT}, and so it is a better choice than SIFT.\@
There appear to be no difference in how to implement either in OpenCV.\@
The process for finding the marker in an image is shown in Figure~\vref{fig:corny_flowchart}.
