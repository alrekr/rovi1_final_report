The implemented visual feature extractors worked in every single test case.
The circle marker is identified down to individual circles, and a total of five unique points are known.
This is done faster than \SI{30}{\fps} or faster than \SI{34}{\milli\second} per frame, which is reasonably fast.
Finding the corny marker takes a while longer;
at \SI{6}{\fps} (\SI{167}{\milli\second} per frame) for the easy sequence and just below \SI{3}{\fps} (\SI{333}{\milli\second}) for the hard sequence,
the method is not suited for time-sensitive implementations.

However, due to health problems relating one of the group members, most of the robotics and the actual visual servoing was not implemented.
