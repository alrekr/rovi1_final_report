\section{Introduction}
This project is about visual servoing. For the vision part we chose marker 1 and marker 3; see Figure~\vref{fig:markers}.
We chose these markers since we found the challenges interesting.
The two markers also demand different solutions.
Although SIFT/SURF could be used to identify the circles, a somewhat more intuitive function is implemented.

And now, somethingwomething about what we will try to show in the report.
