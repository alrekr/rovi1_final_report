\section{Introduction}
The report is the result of the final project in Introduction to Robotics and Computer Vision.
The project is about visual servoing.

Four markers, shown in Figure~\vref{fig:markers}, are available although 2a and 2b are considered to be one.
We chose these markers since we found the challenges interesting.
The two markers also has a good angle for different solutions.
Although SIFT/SURF could be used to identify the circles, a somewhat more intuitive and faster function is implemented.
